After the COVID-19 pandemic, our educational system should switch to the remote. We want to create a platform for building eLearning apps. Firstly we want to create API + Admin panel + Landing Page. Our product basically will be API mainly focused on lessons and tests.

The landing page will be some kind of advertisement and documentation. We want to create high-end software using Microservices, this code will be elastic and highly customizable.

We want to create a universal platform for every kind of science/topic. This tool could be base for web/mobile apps.

Detailed documentation for Frontend and Backend can be found in docs/ directory.
